Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds (A) Or bends with the remover to remove no it is an ever fixèd mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken It is the star to every wand'ring bark Whose worth's unknown although his height be takenLove's not time's fool though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks But bears it out even to the edge of doom If this be error and upon me proved I never writ, nor no man ever loveWhen forty winters shall besiege thy brow And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field Thy youth’s proud livery so gazed on now Will be a tattered weed of small worth held Then being asked where all thy beauty lies Where all the treasure of thy lusty days To say, within thine own deep sunken eyesWere an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise How much more praise deserv’d thy beauty’s use,If thou couldst answer ‘This fair child of mineShall sum my count, and make my old excuse,’Proving his beauty by succession thine.This were to be new made when thou art old,And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold.Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,Now is the time that face should form another,Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.For where is she so fair whose uneared wombDisdains the tillage of thy husbandryOr who is he so fond will be the tombOf his self-love to stop posterityThou art thy mother’s glass and she in theeCalls back the lovely April of her prime,So thou through windows of thine age shaltsee,Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.But if thou live remembered not to be,Die single and thine image dieswiththee.Music to hear, why hear’st thou music sadly?Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:Why lov’st ththat which thou receiv’st not gladly,Or else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy?If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,Byunions married do offend thine ear,They do but sweetly chide thee, who confoundsIn singleness the parts that thoushouldst bearMark how one string sweet husband to another,Strikes each in each by mutual orderingResembling sire,child,and happy mother,Who all in one, one pleasing note do singWhose speechless song being many, seeming one Sings this to thee, ‘Thou single wilt prove noneIs it for fear to wet a widow’s eye,That thou consum’st thy self in single lifeAh, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,The world will be thy widow andstill weep,That thou no form of thee hast left behind,When every private widow well may keep,By children’s eyes, hehusband’s shape in mind:Look what an unthrift in the world doth spendShifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;But beauty’s waste hath in the world an end,And kept unused the user so destroys it:No love toward others in that bosom sitsThat on himself such murd’rous shame commits.Shall I compare thee to a summer’s dayThou art more lovely and more temperateRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:Sometime too hot the eyeof heaven shines,And often is his gold complexion dimmed,And every fair from fair sometime declines,By chance, ornature’s changing course untrimmed:But thy eternal summer shall not fade,Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,Norshall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st,So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.glass shall not persuade me I am old,So long as youth and thou are of one date,But when in thee time’s furrows I behold,Then look I death my days should expiate.For all that beautythat doth cover thee,Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,How can Ithen be elder than thou artO therefore love be of thyself so wary,As I not for my self, but for thee will,Bearing thyheartwhich I will keep so charyAs tender nurse her babe from faring ill.Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,Thogav’st me thine not to give back again.Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,Thy beauty’s form itable of my heart,My body is the frame wherein  held,And perspective it is best painter’s art.For through the painter mustyou seehis skill,To find where your true image pictured lies,Which in my bosom’s shop is hanging still,That hath his windowglazed with thine eyesNow see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for meAre windows to my breast, where-through the sunDelights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,They draw but what they see, know not the heart.Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,A maid of Dian’s this advantage found,And his love-kindling fire did quickly steepIn a cold valley-fountain of that ground:Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,A dateless lively heat still to endure,And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove,Againststrange maladies a sovereign cure:But at my mistress’ eye Love’s brand new-fired,The boy for trial needs would touch my breast,I sick withal the help of bath desired,And thither hied a sad distempered guest.But found no cure, the bath for my help lies,Where Cupid got new fire mThe little Love-god lying once asleep,Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand,The fairest votary took up that fire,Which many legions of true hearts had warmed,And so the general of hot desire,Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed.This brand she quenched in a cool well by,Which from Love’s fire took heat perpetual,Growing a bath and healthfulremedy,For men discased, but I my mistress’ thrall,Came there for cure and this by that I prove,Love’s fire heats water, water cools not love.
