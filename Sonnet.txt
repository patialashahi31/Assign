Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds (A) Or bends with the remover to remove no it is an ever fixèd mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken It is the star to every wand'ring bark Whose worth's unknown although his height be taken
Love's not time's fool though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks But bears it out even to the edge of doom If this be error and upon me proved I never writ, nor no man ever loved
