From fairest creatures we desire increase That thereby beauty’s rose might never die But as the riper should by time decease His tender heir might bear his memory But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes Feed thy lights flame with self-substantial fuelMaking a famine where abundance lies Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament And only herald to the gaudy spring Within thine own bud buriest thy content And tender churl  makt waste in niggarding Pity the world or else this glutton be To eat the world dueby the grave and thee
As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow’st In one of thine, from that which thou departest And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow’st Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase Without this folly, age, and cold decay If all were minded so, the times should cease And threescore year would make the world away Let those whom nature hath not made for store Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die
Devouring Time blunt thou the lion’s paws And make the earth devour her own sweet broodPluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger jawsAnd burn the long-lived phoenix, in her bloodMake glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetstAnd do whateer thou wilt swift-footed TimeTo the wide world and all her fading sweetsBut I forbid thee one most heinous crimeO carve not with thy hours my love’s fair browNor draw no lines there with thine antique penHim in thy course untainted do allowFor beauty’s pattern to succeeding menYet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrongMy love shall in my verse ever live young
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;To thee I send this written embassageTo witness duty, not to show my wit.Duty so great, which wit so poor as mineMay make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;But that I hope some good conceit of thineIn thy soul’s thought (all naked) will bestow it:Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,Points on me graciously with fair aspect,And puts apparel on my tattered loving,To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous dayAnd make me travel forth without my cloak, To let base clouds o’ertake me in my way, Hiding thy brav’ry in their rotten smoke Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break, To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face, For no man well of such a salve can speak, That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace: Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss, Th’ offender’s sorrow lends but weak relief To him that bears the strong offence’s cross. Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.
Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all, What hast thou then more than thou hadst before No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call, All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more: Then if for my love, thou my love receivest, I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest, But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest By wilful taste of what thy self refusest. I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief Although thou steal thee all my poverty:And yet love knows it is a greater griefTo bear greater wrong, than hate’s known injury. Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows, Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war, How to divide the conquest of thy sight, Mine eye, my heart thy picture’s sight would bar, My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right, My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie, (A closet never pierced with crystal eyes) But the defendant doth that plea deny, And says in him thy fair appearance lies. To side this title is impanelled A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart, And by their verdict is determined The clear eye’s moiety, and the dear heart’s part. As thus, mine eye’s due is thy outward part, And my heart’s right, thy inward love of heart.
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme, But you shall shine more bright in these contents Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time. When wasteful war shall statues overturn, And broils root out the work of masonry, Nor Mars his sword, nor war’s quick fire shall burn The living record of your memory. Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity Shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room, Even in the eyes of all posterity That wear this world out to the ending doom. So till the judgment that your self arise, You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.
Against my love shall be as I am now With Time’s injurious hand crushed and o’erworn, When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn Hath travelled on to age’s steepy night, And all those beauties whereof now he’s king Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight, Stealing away the treasure of his spring: For such a time do I now fortify Against confounding age’s cruel knife, That he shall never cut from memory My sweet love’s beauty, though my lover’s life. His beauty shall in these black lines be seen And they shall live, and he in them still green.
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect, For slander’s mark was ever yet the fair, The ornament of beauty is suspect, A crow that flies in heaven’s sweetest air. So thou be good, slander doth but approve, Thy worth the greater being wooed of time, For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love, And thou present’st a pure unstained prime. Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days, Either not assailed, or victor being charged, Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise, To tie up envy, evermore enlarged, If some suspect of ill masked not thy show Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
Lo in the orient when the gracious light Lifts up his burning head, each under eye Doth homage to his new-appearing sight Serving with looks his sacred majesty And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill Resembling strong youth in his middle age Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still Attending on his golden pilgrimage But when from highmost pitch with weary car Like feeble age he reeleth from the day The eyes  now converted are From his low tract and look another way So thou thy self out-going in thy noon Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.
